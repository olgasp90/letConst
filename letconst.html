            <p> What is the difference between var and let?</p>
            <p><strong>var</strong> is function scoped and <strong>let</strong> is block scoped. A variable declared with <strong>var</strong> can be reassigned and redeclared, while a variable declared with <strong>let</strong> can be reassigned, but never redeclared</p>

            <p>What is hoisting?</p>
            <p>Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of 'moving declarations to the top'. That means that a variable declared with <strong>var</strong> that exists in the document can be 'seen' that it exists before we actually see it's value and if we console.log that variable we will get <em>undefined</em></p>
